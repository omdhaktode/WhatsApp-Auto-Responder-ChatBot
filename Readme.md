Project Work:<br>
1.Automation Setup: Uses pyautogui to click/drag on WhatsApp, copy chat history, and detect the last sender.
<br>
2.AI Response: Checks if Meta AI sent the last message; if not, GPT-3.5 generates a reply in the userâ€™s tone (Hindi/English).
<br>
3.Reply Handling: Pastes the AI response (or a default message) into WhatsApp and sends it automatically.
<br>
4.Loop: Runs continuously, checking for new messages every few seconds.
<br>
<br>
Objectives:<br>
1.Automate responses on WhatsApp when the user is unavailable.
<br>
2.Use AI (GPT-3.5) to generate context-aware replies mimicking the user's personality.
<br>
3.Detect if the last message was from Meta AI to avoid unnecessary replies.
<br>
4.Provide seamless integration with WhatsApp via PyAutoGUI for message extraction and sending.
<br>
<br>
Advantages:<br>
1.Saves time by auto-responding to messages intelligently.
<br>
2.Customizable AI responses to match the user's tone (e.g., bilingual support for Hindi & English).
<br>
3.Works without WhatsApp API, using simple GUI automation.
<br>
4.Reduces manual effort in repetitive chat interactions.
<br><br>
Future Scope:<br>
1.Integrate WhatsApp Business API for a more stable solution
<br>
2.Add multilingual support for broader usability.
<br>
3.Implement sentiment analysis for more personalized replies.
<br>
4.Extend to other messaging platforms like Telegram or Messenger.
